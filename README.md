# Multiverse OS: Design Principals And Guidelines 
=================================================
Multiverse OS is intended to be a collaborative effort, and volunteers are 
encouraged to participate and contribute as the project takes shape, and 
becomes increasingly useful to a wider audience. Multiverse OS is a first of a 
kind general purpose clustering software for endusers; rather than the
datacenter. It is designed to both secure all a persons' devices into
essentially a super computer.

**General Use Operating System With Unparalleled Security**
By leveraging cutting edge techology almost exclusively only available and 
understandable by corporate information technologists or academics; these 
tools are being improved, redesigned, and repurposed for general use.

A stark contrast to other security focused Linux distriubtions that often have
that attitude that their distributions are not meant for gaming, or torrenting. 
Multiverse OS is attempting to provide the most secure possible computer
experience, presented in a user friendly and intuitive user experience that 
will surpass OSX; while providing OSX virtual machines enabling Multiverse OS 
users access to all the exclusive OSX software. 

**Modern Re-imagining The Linux User Experience**
While making dramatic changes throughout the user experience, Multiverse OS 
also desires to maintain complete usability with existing Linux users by
maintaining legacy features always available by default alongside the new
Multiverse OS user experience. 

**Open Source Hardware And The Actual Cloud**
Multiverse OS clusters with mobile devices, and a growing amount of 
auxillary hardware; aiming to incorporate old and new devices alike utilizing a
variety of unique and inexpensive open source hardware solutionas that will be 
made freely available. Every component for their design from circuit board 
, case, and firmware will be freely available; in addition Multiverse OS
foundation, and volunteers will be able to offer completed versions, with
potential upgrades, hacks. 

The first public release will completely abstract and hide all complexity
associated with clustering, identity, activity, and process compartmentalizaiton
using full hardware virtualizatized ephemeral virtual machines.
