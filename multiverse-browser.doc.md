## Multiverse OS: Warp (Browser) Engine 
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)

The Warp Browser engine is a feature complete browser engine developed in Go;
and is the engine that powers the Multiverse Browser. 

The Multiverse Browser is intended to be a new alternative open source browser,
that will for the time being implement Browser functionality matching Firefox,
and abstract further functionality ontop of the Browser to provide new
functionality that can be acheived with extensions on other browsers but
implementation through extension will not provide the same level of security
provided by Multiverse Browser. 

Multiverse Browser takes advantage of three new protocols that are to be
released with Multiverse OS's alpha launch. 

  * **The Gravity Protocol** which provides mechanisms for multiparty
    computation using multisignatures, and a per-network defined trust network;
    Multiverse Foundation will provide its own trust network, as a specifcation
    design, but the Gravity protocol is designed to support a variety of
    networks, connected through our oht routing, and metadata storage. This
    original layer established by OHT enables incredibly small networks to
    remain active and viable, and support large networks with complex
    abstractions, and network requirements; by only using the oht to bootstrap
    a Gravity Network's overlay network, which is also defind by the network
    definition. 

> Two Components of the Gravity Protocol are defined by the Network
> Specification, or organizational charter: (1) The model for the trust network,
> which can result in a mutable, or immutable model; and (2) The design of the
> overlay network used to connect members of the network. 

    The Multiverse OS Foundation, that will provide for ongoing development,
    support, and small-scale manufacturing of our open-source hardware, required
    to experience Multiverse OS as it was intended to be experienced: using
    hardware compartmentalizaiton, over VMs or Conatiners, for greater security
    and speed.

    *There is no longer any need to debate which one is superior. It was Virtual
    Machines; before Multiverse OS implemented the ephemeral 
    compartmentalization security model using Hardware built from an array of 
    Lattice (open source) FPGAs, and (open source) ARM64 processors arranged in
    a super computer-style configuration and built in a way that they can not
    just be stored in a variety of form-factors; including mobile "phone",
    "tablet", and rack server models. The complete design, from schematic, CAD
    of circuit boards, chips, cases, and specialized security enhanced
    peripherals; will all be open source, the firmware will be open source, and
    he binaries stored on every flashable chip will be tracked using checksums,
    and verifiable against a cluster wide merkle tree. Updates will not only be
    signed by a single developer, or a developer acting on behalf of the
    developers, but each developer will build the firmware, and confirm that the
    deterministic build is valid and include their signature in a multisignature
    verification. Finally when the chip is flashed, the administrator, or user
    of the cluster, automaticaly has their key sign the resulting checksum. 

    This wholistic approach to upgrading every flashable chip that is included
    in Multiverse OS open source designs, is an example of the security first,
    clean-room style approach used in by Multiverse OS development protocol. 

    Unlike other projects, that rely on a cult-of-personality, Multiverse OS
    relies not just on a single team developing and producing updates, but a
    community of dedicated computer scientists, who understand the importantance
    of fully open architecture, providing users with not just root access to all
    their devices, bu a simple and standardized protocol to updating their
    system down to their firmware through a secure protocol. The available
    updates are defined by the number of signatures on each of the current
    branches, and users and developers are free to work on whatever they feel
    represents the best path forward. 

    This is accomplished using a different model for Open Source development
    altogether. One where, a project created on the Multiverse OS public
    repository hub, never has an owner, just as a person working on he next type
    of inventive math equation does not mainain ownership over the community
    accepted equation. Instead they register the idea, because like Math
    comptuer science, and all science is self-evident, and claiming ownership
    does not only fail to understand the universal nature of these subjects, but
    also understand that applying models of ownership that apply not just to a
    instance of the universal concept; but insist on assuming that the model for
    physical, tangible items, should be applied to universal, and intangible
    thoughts. 

    I will not waste my time in explaining why this is not jus absurd, but has
    proven itself to function as a snare, binding the hands of scientists,
    researchers; limiting their ability to even read each others work, and have
    discussions, but also allow corporations to own the equivilent to the number
    "2"; and charging any academic organization wishing to use it.
